           <h2>My Background</h2>
           <p>
               I was born in Connecticut and spent 7 years living there with my parents and my 
               evntual sister before we moved to Florida. I spent the rest of my childhood and 
               early adulthood in Florida. I played softball for most of my life, until an 
               injury sidelined me in high school. I went to Florida State University (Go 
               Noles!) and majored in History & Political Science. I still wasn't sure what I 
               wanted for myself and my future when I graduated and I happened to "fall" into 
               teaching. I was a math teacher for 4 years before I met my husband and we got 
               pregnant with our first child. Seeing as he is a Marine, after she was born, we 
               joined him in Virginia at MCB Quantico. We have since had two more kids and I 
               have had the absolute pleasure of being able to be home with my kids while they
               were babies. Now that two out of three are school aged and my husband will be 
               retired from the MC in May, it is time to focus on myself.

           <h2>Why Web Development, Why Now?</h2>
           <p>
               I have always had an osession of sorts, with figuring out technology
               and making it work for me the way I want it to. I enjoy "playing around"
               with things and tweaking them until they look the way I want them to look.
               I know have the time to focus on myself which has involved some serious 
               introspection on what I would like to do. I wanted something I would enjoy
               and something that I could turn into a career. When I narrowed it down, 
               there really was only one option. Web development allows me the challenge of
               constantly learning new things and figuring out how things work best while 
               also allowing me to do something I know I already enjoy.
